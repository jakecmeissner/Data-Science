My essay is about if Universal Basic Income is the answer for wealth inequality in America, particularly as it pertains to the ongoing issue of automation. The audience of my essay is a general audience, even though it is particularly concerning the United States of America as its focus. I will write my essay in a way that somebody who either doesn't know about or doesn't support the idea of a UBI would give it a second thought, because the vast majority of people being aware is the only way it will ever get through legislation in the long run.
